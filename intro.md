## What's News

## Read All About It

_From the Editor's Desk ..._

Welcome to the 1st edition of the Daily PL. It's an honor to have such a high circulation. We have almost as many daily subscribers as the Wall Street Journal or the Cincinnati Enquirer (the latter, facetious statement is close enough to the truth that it's really not that funny) Throughout the semester I, Will Kent, will write (sometimes not so) short recaps of what we discuss in class. These materials are for you to use to learn and are absolutely a resource that you can rely on during the exams and when you do your homework. I hope that you enjoy!

_Sincerely_,

Will K.

## That's What We Are Talking 'Bout

1. _programming language_: A system for communicating computational ideas between people and computing machines.
1. _syntax_: The rules for constructing structurally valid (note: valid, not correct) computer programs in a particular language.
1. _names_: A means of identifying "entities" in a programming language.
1. _types_: A way to denote the categories of values that a program can manipulate. (A more specific definition will come later in the course). 
1. _semantics_: The effect of each statement's execution on the program's operation.

## What Is The Meaning Of This

There are (three or) four (depending on how you count) fundamental components of every programming language: syntax, names, types, and semantics.

For your favorite programming language, attempt to explain the most meaningful parts of its syntax. Think about what constitutes valid identifiers in the language, how consecutive statements are separated, how code is grouped, etc.

Next, ask yourself how your favorite language handles types. Are variables in your favorite language given types explicitly or implicitly? If the language you love is compiled, are types assigned to variables before the code is compiled or as the program executes? These (and others) are the types of issues that we will discuss in detail in Module 2.

Consider how statements in your favorite programming language affect the program's execution. Does the language have loops? if-then statements? goto statements? can functions call other functions? can you define functions inside other functions?

Finally, does any of _that_ capture what makes your favorite language your favorite language? Or is it something else? Would _hate_ a language that does _not_ have the characteristics of your favorite language? Would you refuse to code in any language other than you favorite?
